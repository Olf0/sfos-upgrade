# Using bash (formally) because it is "always there" on SailfishOS: Either the
# real bash 3.2.57 (the last GPLv2 version) on SailfishOS less than v4 or via
# busybox's bash-symlink (which is deployed by the busybox-symlinks-bash RPM)
# since SailfishOS 4.  Note that busybox's ash support "-o pipefail", but not
# "-o posix"; setting POSIXLY_CORRECT seems to achive the same without
# compatibility issues, plus (when exported) also for a number of other GNU
# utilities.
# Nevertheless, this script is still a Bourne (not-"Again") Shell script and
# shall stay free of bashisms.
